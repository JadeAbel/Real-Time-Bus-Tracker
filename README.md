# Bus Tracker

## Real Time Bus Tracker Exercise

Project Title: Real Time Bus Tracker

Description: Upon clicking the 'Show Stops Between MIT and Harvard' button, an icon will momentarily stop at each bus stop between the schools.

Usage: FUN (and potentially practical transit use!)

HOW TO RUN: Open the index.html file on your browser. You may need to clone this repository to your machine.

Support: Email jade.marie.abel@gmail.com

Roadmap: In the future, I would like to make a similar map for the City of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh also makes their bus API data available to the public. In that future project, I think it'd be interesting to incorporate topography. Pittsburgh is very hilly and has disjointed population centers, so that map would be really interesting I'm sure.
